# Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing cervical cancer risk factors and building a predictive model using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of an XGBoost classifier to predict biopsy results.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. After cloning the repository, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly xgboost scikit-learn jupyterthemes
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cervical-cancer-analysis.git
   cd cervical-cancer-analysis
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cervical_cancer_analysis.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python cervical_cancer_analysis.py
   ```

## Data

The project uses the 'cervical_cancer.csv' dataset, which contains various risk factors and a biopsy result for cervical cancer. The dataset includes demographic information, habits, and medical history.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Data type conversion

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Correlation analysis
   - Distribution of features

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Feature selection
   - Train-test split
   - XGBoost Classifier implementation
   - Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

## Results

The results of the analysis include:
- Visualizations of data distributions and correlations
- Performance metrics of the XGBoost classifier
- Feature importance analysis

(Note: Detailed results should be added after running the analysis)
